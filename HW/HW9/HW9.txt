My approach to this assigment involving creating a tree and finds the lowest common ancestor between p and q by using recursion. 
The lowestCommonAncestor method checks the root too see if it is null and then loops to see if p and q are less than or greater
than the current node. If the current is greater, then both nodes are on the right side of the tree and moves the current to its right child. 
If it is less than, then both nodes are on the left side of the tree and moves the current to its left child. It loops until the current 
becomes none.
