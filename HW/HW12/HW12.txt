For this assignment, I implemented Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST 
of the graph formed by houses and pipes. The cost of building wells and laying pipes 
are added into the AllEdges list. Kruskal's algo will iterate through the sorted edges and 
check if they form a cycle. If they do not form a cycle then they will be added to the MST
The find method will find the root of a set. The given test case is tested in the main method.
