My approach for this hw uses BFS in order to implement the levelOrder method.
The levelOrder method will initlize an empty result list and dequeue to
store the nodes to be processed. It will put the root node into the queue
then itereate through processing the nodes one level at a time. 
Every time a node is processed, it appends the value to the current 
level list and adds the children to the queue. It appends the current level to the 
results list and will repeat until the queue is empty.

For the test cases, they it will take the result and if it is null then it 
will output None and if the result is not empty then it will print the a list of 
lists containing the node values at each level.
