I approached this lab using recursion. The isValid method validates
the subtree by taking the minimum value, maximum val and the node. 
If the value of node is in range, then the function will call itself
recursively for the left/right subtrees. The max value of the left
subtree will be updated to node.val and the nodes in this subtree must 
have values less than node.val. The min value of teh right subtree will be updated
and the values must be greater than node.val.
