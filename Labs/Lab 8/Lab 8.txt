For this lab I used a BFS approach to go through all the combinations of coins. 
It uses a queue to store what needs to be processed and a set to keep track of the
visited amounts. The outer loop iterates until there are no more amounts that need to 
be processed. The inner loop goes through the current level of the BFS tree. It will subtract the 
coin value from it to generate the possible next amounts for each amount. It adds the next valid amounts 
to the queue and marks it as visited. The test cases are given in the main functions of the code.
