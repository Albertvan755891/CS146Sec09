Python ver explanation: This code uses sorted function to sort the characters in both strings and compare
the sorted lists. If the lists are equal the method returns true, if not return false. 

Java Explanation: In this lab, I used an if statement to check if the length of s and t are the same
If they are not the method will return false because they are different lengths. Then strings
s and t are converted into arrays. Then the arrays are compared, if the arrays are identical then 
the method returns true as they are anagrams otherwise it returns false. Some test cases are put 
into the main method to check.
