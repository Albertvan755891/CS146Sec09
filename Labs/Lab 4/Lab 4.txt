My approach to this assignment was to use recursion to invert the tree. 
I created a tree and for my invertTree method, it checks if the root is empty. 
Then it moves down the tree, swapping the left and right children of the current 
root node. The invertTree method is recursively called on the left and right subtrees. 
This continues until it goes through the whole tree. Then returns the root.
