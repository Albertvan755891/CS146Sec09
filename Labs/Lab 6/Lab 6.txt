For this assignment I used a graph and used a DFS algorithm to traverse the graph. 
The canFinish method checks if it is possible to finish all courses based on the number
of courses and their prereqs. An outer list storing a course and an inner list storing the prerequisites for 
each course is created. We iterate over the prerequisite array and add each prerequisite to its 
corresponding course to populate the grpah. We then use a DFS algorithm to iterate through each course and 
have the hasCycle method check whether or not there is a cycle. If it detects a cycle the method will return false as 
it is not possible to finish all the courses. IF there is no cycle then the method will return True meaning that it is possible to finish
all the courses. The test cases are included in the main method below.
